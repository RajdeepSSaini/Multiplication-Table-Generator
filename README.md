# QUESTION
Develop a JavaScript program to generate a multiplication table on a web page. The program should prompt the user to input the number of rows and columns for the table dynamically.


# JavaScript Multiplication Table Generator
Welcome to the JavaScript Multiplication Table Generator repository! This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for generating multiplication tables dynamically on a web page. It's designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind, making it particularly useful for college students and anyone interested in learning JavaScript.


## Features
- **Dynamic Input:** Allows users to specify the number of rows and columns for the multiplication table. 
- **Interactive Display:** Generates the multiplication table directly on the web page, providing a visual representation of multiplication operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for inputting parameters and viewing the generated table.


## How It Works
The program utilizes JavaScript to handle user input and dynamically create an HTML table displaying the multiplication results. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:
1. **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns desired for the table.
2. **Table Generation:** Generates an HTML table structure using JavaScript, populating it with the multiplication results based on the user-provided dimensions.
3. **Display:** Renders the generated table on the web page, allowing users to easily view and interact with the multiplication table.


## Why Use This Tool?
This Multiplication Table Generator can be immensely helpful for college students in several ways:
- **Educational Purposes:** Provides a practical example of using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and perform calculations. 
- **Learning JavaScript:** Offers hands-on experience in JavaScript programming, reinforcing concepts such as loops, functions, and user input handling.
- **Customization:** Students can modify the code to add features or improve functionality, fostering creativity and exploration in programming.
